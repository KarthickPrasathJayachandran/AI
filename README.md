Purpose of adding crowd:
                Crowd is added to make the environment more realistic. Most of the places feels empty without crowds for example clubs, pubs, markets etc. Adding people in unity is easy but giving actions or animations is the toughest job. Because in a crowd different persons do different actions. Same way we must add different animations to them according to their actions and purpose. 
Purpose of Dialogue:
               Communication is a valuable thing for sharing information. Though it’s possible to convey with visuals, words are important. Dialogue system can be added in unity using various tools but, in this project, I used yarn spinner to add a dialogue system. Yarn spinner is a handy tool for adding dialogue tree. There is a conversation between the player and the officer in the parking lot in my project.
Purpose of story:
                Without a story there is no content. Each and everything happening in this world has a story. Each person in the world has their own story in life. Without the story there is no point of making movie or even games. There are games which doesn’t have story but there could be a story behind making that game. 
Mindset:
        I learned few animation techniques by doing my last assignment and I tried implementing them here. I am not sure about the output, but I will accept the feedbacks to improve myself. I need more time to learn about the crowd system because in this project, I added only one animation. I am not that great on adding crowd system. For the Yarn Spinner, it felt like I understood but it’s not. It not that easy as it looks, it also needs more practice to create proper UI with proper dialogue tree.
